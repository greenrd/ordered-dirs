Creates a virtual filesystem which contains symbolic links to files in
the specified directory that are mentioned in a `.order` file. The
symbolic link filenames are prefixed with consecutive integers, so that
they appear in the same order as the original filenames appear in the
`.order` file.

You can use this to easily prioritise tasks represented by directories
or files.
